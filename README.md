### About ###


[GeoPackage MapCache](http://ngageoint.github.io/geopackage-mapcache-ios/) is a [GeoPackage Library](http://ngageoint.github.io/GeoPackage/) app for iOS that utilizes and demonstrates the functionality in [GeoPackage iOS](https://github.com/ngageoint/geopackage-ios).  The GeoPackage SDK is an iOS Objective-C library implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium [GeoPackage](http://www.geopackage.org/) [spec](http://www.geopackage.org/spec/). The app and SDK are listed as [OGC GeoPackage Implementations](http://www.geopackage.org/#implementations_nga) by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


The MapCache app provides read and write access to GeoPackage files, including features and tiles. Features are visualized and editable on the map. Tiles are visualized on the map and can be loaded from a tile provider or WMS url.
